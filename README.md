> A generative deep learning model built in PyTorch to synthesize realistic concrete crack images for robust data augmentation in structural health monitoring.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, a generative model designed to learn the underlying patterns of concrete cracks from a large image dataset.

The ability to generate an endless supply of new, diverse, and realistic training examples is a powerful **data augmentation** technique. It can significantly improve the performance and generalization of downstream computer vision models, such as the crack detectors and segmentation networks used in automated structural inspections.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The VAE is composed of two neural networks working in tandem:
1.  **Encoder:** This network takes a high-resolution input image and compresses it into a low-dimensional latent space, creating a dense vector that captures the essential features of the crack.
2.  **Decoder:** This network takes a point from the latent space and reconstructs it back into a full-resolution image.

By learning this process, the decoder becomes a powerful generator, capable of creating entirely new images from random points sampled from the latent space.

## 📈 Results

### Image Reconstruction
The model first learns to reconstruct images from the dataset, demonstrating that it has successfully captured the core structural features of the cracks.

### Synthetic Image Generation
Once trained, the model can generate an endless supply of new, realistic crack images for data augmentation.
